# Dev Notes

Very raw - trying to understand this project.

## Pictographs

There is a font file in `src/fonts.postcss` that refers to `static/fonts/sitelenselikiwenmonoasuki.woff` and `...woff2`.  This font seems to come from `https://github.com/kreativekorp/sitelen-seli-kiwen` which is a handwritten set of toki-pona fonts.

## Data sources

 - In `src/routes/api/lipamanka/+server.ts` the semantic space dictionary from `https://lipamanka.gay/essays/dictionary` is parsed for words and definitions.

 - In README.md - states `https://tokipona.org/compounds.txt`

 - In README.md - states `https://github.com/lipu-linku/sona/blob/main/words/source/definitions.toml`
